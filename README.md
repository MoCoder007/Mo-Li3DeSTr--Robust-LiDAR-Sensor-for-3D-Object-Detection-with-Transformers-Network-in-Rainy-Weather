# Introduction

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely heavily on LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for precise 3D object detection. However, LiDAR's performance can significantly degrade in rainy conditions, affecting the safety and efficiency of AVs. Mo-Li3DeSTr addresses this challenge by introducing an innovative architecture that enhances the interpretability of noisy data, enabling reliable navigation in diverse weather scenarios.

# Mo-Li3DeSTr: Robust LiDAR Sensor for 3D Object Detection in Rainy Weather

Mo-Li3DeSTr is a cutting-edge research project focused on enhancing 3D object detection capabilities of LiDAR sensors under adverse weather conditions, specifically during rain. Developed by Mohamed Elatfi, Haigen Min, Akram Al-Radaei, and Anass Taoussi at the School of Information Engineering, Chang’an University, China, this project presents a transformative model that integrates transformer networks with LiDAR technology to improve detection robustness.

The Mo-Li3DeSTr project, developed at Chang’an University, represents a significant advancement in the field of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies, especially in enhancing LiDAR sensors' effectiveness under challenging weather conditions such as rain. This integration of transformer networks with LiDAR technology not only improves the robustness of detection systems but also enhances their interpretability when dealing with noisy, rain-distorted data.
